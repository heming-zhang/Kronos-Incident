Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \"Cotton Candy\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. \nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug\'s chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.  \nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash\'s ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days.

The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. \nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf√ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬ø¬øhere you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \n\"We\'ve made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech\'s operations.   \nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.\n');

The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International\'s Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK\'s demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK\'s first martyr and has used Juliana\'s image on campaign literature ever since.  \nThe POK\'s second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  \nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \"public threat\".\n');

Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, \"Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high.\"\nHowever, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.  It is also unclear who will take his mantle in the POK now he is gone. \n');

However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. \nIt spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. \nQ: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?\nA: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population.\nBut there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.\nWhich foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the \"manner of Kronosian\" and to take time to include/understand their personnel.\nQ: Can you work out?\nA: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question.\nThe people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate.\nPatience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.\nQ: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos?\nA: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like obtaining from A with B in a taxi. To be able to obtain around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring.\nAnother ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. \nThe Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control.\nQ: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare?\nA: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family.\nThe foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question.\n[But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you.\nQ: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos?\nA: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life.\nWhen a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturelement they do not have a question with foreigners. \nQ: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage?\nA: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to include/understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.\nSometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas.

Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\" \n\"When we didn\'t make headway with GAStech,\" Reynolds continued, \"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.\n');

But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities.\nMany ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders.\nIn agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trill√≥n, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.\nGAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources.\n\"We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" said very comfortable SanJorge.  \"Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer.\"\nAlthough it has gotten to be only recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never has been made commercially.\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of the university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the European energy in the next decade, but says that he could have potential in the one of more long term.\n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry.

Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources.\nThe \"centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while machinant in very difficult environments\"\nWhen I was a young journalist on the daily disc in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning.\nIt seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination.\nMuch with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.\nWith the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances.\nUnder its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries. \nThe change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.\nAnd while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech. \nSanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing its Jr. and hank Fluss de wire Sten of cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report/ratio for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come.\nThe substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974. \nThus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do.

Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.\"\nIn what way, I asked.\n\"The crops aren\'t producing like they have in the past.

She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.\n\"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. \"\n\"Can these substances occur naturally?\" I asked her.\n\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\"\n\"Did you talk to GAStech about this?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" she replied.  \"At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.\"\nSten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.\n\"When we didn\'t make headway with GAStech,\" Reynolds continued, \"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.\"\nAt this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.\nPart Three will be published May 15, 1998\n');

But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? \nThe Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International\'s Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. \nIn 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK\'s demands were largely ignored and downplayed. \nAlso in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK\'s first martyr and has used Juliana\'s image on campaign literature ever since. \nThe POK\'s second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel\'s death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. \nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \"public threat\".\n');

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> \nContinue reading the main story  \nThe son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. \n\"Certainly offshore gas isn\'t a new concept, but there\'s no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can\'t develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times. \nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. \nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. \nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. \nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech\'s estimates for its onshore resources. \nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. \nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. \nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. \n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It\'s perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.\n');

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.\nIt was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.\nBut I\'d forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what\'s developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.\n\"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\"\nWhen I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.\nMuch to his mother\'s regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. \nThe change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city\'s airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.\nAnd as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. \nSanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. \nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\n');

Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \"Cotton Candy\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.\nPatients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.\nSgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\" in the last month,\" he said.\nBianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.\n\"You don\'t know what you\'re getting when you get it,\" Bianca said. \"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\"\nBianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug\'s chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \"It is another way to sell it,\" she said.\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \"Spice Dreams\" one week and under the name of \"Tulip Blossom\" the next. \nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \"herbal therapy\" products and are available over the counter in area stores.\n\"We still don\'t know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\" Bianca said.\nOne factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.\nCotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash\'s ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \"They crave it,\" she said.\nAfter repeated use, the drug \"fries\" a person\'s brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\" she said.\nWhile it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People\'s Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\n');

He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.\nBut there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader.\nWhat foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the \"way of Kronosian\" and to take time to understand its personnel.\nQ:  Can you elaborate?\nA: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.\nThe people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.\nThe patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.\nQ:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?\nA: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.\nAnother one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. \nQ:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?\nA: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.\nForeign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.\n[But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.\nQ:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?\nA: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard.

But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. \nQ:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?\nA: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.\nThe foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets.

Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.\n\"We didn\'t make the connection at first,\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in \'94, and our problems didn\'t start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\"\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf√© where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.\n\"We\'ve made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven\'t left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\"\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech\'s operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  \nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\nPart Two will be published April 25, 1998\n');

You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city\'s airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. \nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  \nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do.

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>\nContinue reading the main story	\nThe son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned.\nSten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.\nSanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon.\n\"Certainly offshore gas isn\'t a new concept, but there\'s no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can\'t develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times.\nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.\nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.\nMany environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech\'s estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.\n\"We\'re very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" SanJorge said. \"Is any of that exploitable? That\'s the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\"\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.\n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It\'s perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.\" \n');

But the projects in Europe were slow to take off, attacked with the opposition of the government and the local communities.\nSanjorge indicates that it will be in the short run before we know if the gas at sea schist can be exploited.\nMany ecologists believe that hyperacide displacement of substrate can damage the marine environments, and to the extraction new fossile fuel resources are opposed. But drilling at sea avoids the need for difficult negotiations with the councils, the communities and the holder of piece buildings.\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - to 100 cubic feet trillion, which would be more than the evaluations of GAStech for its earth resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.\nGAStech estimated that the resources at sea schist gas of total of Kronos could take place between five and 10 moments the size of terrestrial available of resources.\n\"We are who it resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" said very comfortable SanJorge. \"Is there one that exploitable? It is billion question of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer.\"\nAlthough it very recently became discussed, hyperacide displacement of substrate was employed on one on a smaller scale during much of years, to improve the flow of the conventional gas and oil wells. But to employ the process on a great number of wells had to at sea extract gas from schist commercially was never made.\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of university of Tethys is skeptic approximately if the schist gas at sea could be large contributing to European energy in the following decade, but known as which it could have the longer-term potential.\n\"GAStech is optimistic is its evaluations of how long it will take to explore the schist at sea. It is perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, technology hyperacide of displacement of substrate will have thus advanced and the way in which we treat the marine environment will have thus advanced that this could be a really large industry.
